h1. Introduction

FreeStreamer is an audio player engine for the iPhone/iPad, designed for playing audio streams. The engine has a minimal UI for demonstration; hopefully, it is a helpful example for using the engine.

The engine is written in C++ and the FSAudioController Objective-C class wraps the implementation.

FreeStreamer has the following features:
* Fast and low memory footprint (no overhead of Objective-C method calls)
* Supports ShoutCast and IceCast audio streams + standard HTTP
* Can detect the stream type based on the content type
* Supports ShoutCast metadata
* Supports interruptions (for example a phone call during playing the stream)
* Supports backgrounding

h1. Using the player in your own project

Please follow the following steps to use the player in your own project:

1. Make sure you have the following frameworks linked to your project:
* _AVFoundation.framework_
* _MediaPlayer.framework__
* _CFNetwork.framework_
* _AudioToolbox.framework_

2. If you want to support background audio, add *App plays audio* to the target's *Required background modes*. You can find the property by clicking on the target on Xcode and opening the Info tab.

3. Copy _FSAudioStream.h_, _FSAudioStream.m_, and everything in the _astreamer_ directory to your project. Try building the project now and it should compile successfully.

You can now stream an audio file like this:

<code>
#import "FSAudioStream.h"

FSAudioStream *audioStream = [[FSAudioStream alloc] init];
[audioStream playFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.example.com/audio_file.mp3"]];
</code>

That's it! For more examples, please take a look at the example project. For instance, you may want to observe notifications on the audio stream state.

h1. Reporting bugs and contributing

Your contributions are most welcome. If you want to send code, please a send a patch and make sure it can be merged to the master branch without conflicts.

If you have anything to ask, you can use email.
