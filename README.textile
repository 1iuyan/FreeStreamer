h1. Introduction

FreeStreamer is an audio player engine for the iPhone/iPad, designed for playing audio streams. The engine has a minimal UI for demonstration; hopefully, it is a helpful example for using the engine.

The engine is written in C++ and the FSAudioController Objective-C class wraps the implementation.

FreeStreamer has the following features:
* Fast and low memory footprint (no overhead of Objective-C method calls)
* Supports ShoutCast and IceCast audio streams + standard HTTP
* Can detect the stream type based on the content type
* Supports ShoutCast metadata
* Supports interruptions (for example a phone call during playing the stream)
* Supports backgrounding
